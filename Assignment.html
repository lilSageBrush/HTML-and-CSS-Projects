			<h3>Gendered Language</h3>
				<p>The words we choose to use in a sentence can imply ideas without explicity stating them. For example, the pronouns used in a sentence tell us the gender of the subject. If one only refers to software developers with he pronouns it could subtly imply that only men are software developers. The people in power should actively try to change the status quo so that misogynist patterns aren't repeated. A great way to challenge the status quo is to acknowledge that anybody can be involved in STEM. This can be implemented by using inclusive language like the gender-neutral they.</p>
			<h3>An Excerpt on How Gendered Language Affects Biases</h3>
				<blockquote cite="https://cakeandarrow.com/newsfeed/2017/10/16/words-of-wisdom-workplace-language-gender-equality/">While language reflects our cultural biases, it also continues to shape them. To illustrate this point, each woman in the Archery Club was asked to take what is called the Gender-Career IAT, a test developed by Project Implicit designed to evaluate whether a person possesses an implicit gender bias against women with careers. Nearly every woman who took the test showed some kind of association with women and family vs. men and careers (there were 1 or 2 exceptions), while no one in the room actually professed to believe that a woman belonged in the home, not in the workplace. Such results point to the gap between beliefs and biases, and how, despite our best efforts, we can inherit the cultural biases embedded in language.</blockquote>
