			<h3>Gendered Language</h3>
			<p>The words we choose to use in a sentence can imply ideas without explicity stating them. For example, the pronouns used in a sentence tell us the gender of the subject. If one only refers to software developers with he pronouns it could subtly imply that only men are software developers. The people in power should actively try to change the status quo so that misogynist patterns aren't repeated. A great way to challenge the status quo is to acknowledge that anybody can be involved in STEM. This can be implemented by using inclusive language like the gender-neutral they.</p>
